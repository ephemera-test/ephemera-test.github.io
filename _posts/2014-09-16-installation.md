Ephemera was first conceived as an installation, and it is in this context that the synaesthethic properties of the project are most evident, with visitors immersing themselves in scent, sound and visual elements. The aim is to explore a disorienting and rewarding interzone where the human senses blur. The focus on the olfactory opens up new interactions between scent and sound, image and light, the material and the immaterial.<br>  

The installation was first launched at Audio Visual Arts in New York in April 2014 in a one-room space, with different Bass, Noise and Drone presented at various times. 
<br>  
The second phase is more extensive, taking place at Unsound Krakow from 12 - 19 October 2014 at the Polish National Museum, across five rooms. The Noise, Drone and Bass rooms also contain an improvised structure created by Polish artist Piotr Jakubowicz. In two separate rooms, Marcel Weber (MFO) and Manuel Sepulveda present their visual reinterpretations of these fusions of scent and sound in a form of video works and graphic patterns printed on canvas.<br>  

From 23 - 26 October, the Ephemera will travel to the Tromsø Center For Contemporary Art in Noway, where it will be installed as part of Insomnia Festival.
