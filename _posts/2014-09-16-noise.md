Geza Schoen created the scent representing Noise inspired by way of Ben Frost’s deepest recesses of olfactory memories: catholic church holidays, Australian bushfire, moisture, and insect drones, among other stimuli. Those ideas Schoen connected with aldehydes, ozone, black pepper, saffron, and labdanum, to name a few.

**Ben Frost on Noise**    
  
- *‘Herein’ is drawn from the deepest recesses of my olfactory memory.*   
- *Ash Wednesday: The creeping haze of burning trees, distant crackling, the muffled roar and siren, suffocating wind, heat and the physical noise - the looming spectre of Australian bushfire. We wear wool. Sheep don’t easily burn, you see.*     
- *My Grandfathers workshop: Soldering, electrical burns- the cycling whine of angle grinders and the showering sparks of an arc welder. The rust, the damp, the wood, the sweat.*   
- *Church on Sundays: Crackling radio-mic sermon, always cold, bluestone, frost, and frankincense.*  
- *The back of the hunting truck: moisture and insect drones, mould and gunpowder, empty shells and diesel in jerry cans.* 
- *The buzz of flies over sticky blood.*
