Ephemera presents olfactory compositions based on musical resonances and reverberations. The nose behind the project is Berlin-based Geza Schoen, known for the groundbreaking Escentric Molecules series as well as various avant-garde/conceptual scents. 

<br/>


In the first phase of the project, three musicians - Ben Frost, Tim Hecker, and Steve Goodman (aka Kode<span class="kode">9</span>) - created raw sonic material which Schoen then reinterpreted to create three different scents: Noise, Drone and Bass. 
<br/>


These scents and sounds are now used in an installation environment, and also encapsulated as unique perfumes.

<br/>
The project is curated and produced by Malgorzata Plysa and Mat Schulz of Unsound.
